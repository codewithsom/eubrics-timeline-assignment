# AcmeCorp Project Status Analysis - Day Zero PM Assessment

## SITUATION RECONSTRUCTION

### What the Client is Expecting:
1. **Compliance-Approved LMS Structure**: Client's compliance team flagged the demo structure as not meeting expectations
2. **Interactive Features & Gamified Nudges**: Discussed in onboarding but not visible in current implementation
3. **Proctoring Engine**: Powerful anti-cheating system for assessments, quizzes, and action cards
4. **Enhanced Quiz Templates**: Support for multiple correct answers, drag-and-drop, match-the-following, image-based questions
5. **New Joiner Activation Management**: System to handle sudden additions without impacting completion statistics
6. **Go-Live Checklist**: Client requested by tomorrow with realistic timeline

### What Has Been Committed So Far:
**COMPLETED:**
- Whitelisting 
- Access Testing (needs SSO re-verification)
- UAT 

**PENDING/AT RISK:**
- SSO, SAML Certificate (Client dependency)
- UAT Feedback (Client dependency)
- Updated User List and Data (Client dependency)
- Setup verification (Tech Team responsibility)
- DIY handover to client
- Teaser campaigns (4 days and 2 days before orientation)
- User Orientation scheduled for Dec 14

### What's At Risk or Unclear:

**HIGH RISK:**
1. **Timeline Pressure**: 3-week go-live with multiple pending items
2. **Scope Creep**: New requirements (proctoring, quiz variations) not in original scope
3. **Client Dependencies**: Multiple items waiting on client (SSO cert, UAT feedback, user data)
4. **Technical Gaps**: API configuration issues, content delivery delays

**UNCLEAR/AMBIGUOUS:**
1. **Content Format**: Short-form vs long-form slides not decided
2. **Gamification Scope**: Extent of interactive features unclear
3. **Resource Allocation**: Who owns go-live checklist after previous PM departure
4. **Compliance Requirements**: Specific compliance needs not documented

**COMMUNICATION GAPS:**
1. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Internal teams raising different concerns
2. **Expectation Mismatch**: Demo didn't match client expectations
3. **Feature Clarity**: Gamified nudges discussed but not implemented

## IMMEDIATE RISKS TO ADDRESS:
- Client confidence shaken by demo feedback
- Technical team struggling with API configuration
- Content team blocked on slide format decision
- No clear ownership of critical path items
- Potential scope expansion without timeline adjustment
