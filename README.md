# AcmeCorp Project Status - Internal Leadership Update
**Date:** July 14, 2025  
**From:** Somya Rawat
**Re:** AcmeCorp Phase 1 Go-Live Status & Immediate Actions

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I've assumed PM responsibilities for AcmeCorp's Phase 1 rollout following the previous PM's departure. After analyzing project artifacts and stakeholder communications, **we have a recoverable situation that requires immediate action and stakeholder realignment**.

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### **COMPLETED ITEMS**
- Whitelisting, Access Testing, UAT completed
- Core platform functionality validated
- Initial client demo delivered

### **CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**
1. **Scope Misalignment**: Client expects features not in current build (proctoring engine, advanced quiz formats, gamified nudges)
2. **Client Dependencies Blocking Progress**: SSO certificate, UAT feedback, updated user data all pending from client
3. **Technical Challenges**: API configuration issues causing content delivery delays
4. **Communication Breakdown**: Demo didn't meet compliance expectations, creating client confidence issues

### **HIGH-RISK ITEMS**
- **Timeline Pressure**: 3-week go-live with multiple unresolved dependencies
- **Feature Gap**: Proctoring, quiz variations, new joiner management not scoped/built
- **Client Confidence**: Compliance team flagged demo structure as inadequate
- **Resource Clarity**: No clear ownership of critical path items post-PM departure

## IMMEDIATE 72-HOUR ACTION PLAN

### **TODAY (Day 1)**
- **9 AM**: Emergency stakeholder alignment call with dev-lead, content-head, product-ops
- **11 AM**: Client call with Anita to acknowledge concerns and reset expectations
- **2 PM**: Technical deep-dive on API issues and proctoring requirements
- **4 PM**: Scope assessment meeting - what's feasible vs. what needs timeline adjustment

### **Day 2**
- **Morning**: Deliver revised go-live checklist to client with realistic timelines
- **Afternoon**: Begin parallel workstreams: technical fixes + scope negotiation
- **EOD**: Client approval on revised timeline and scope boundaries

### **Day 3**
- **Morning**: Kick-off sprint planning with adjusted scope
- **Afternoon**: Begin implementation of critical path items
- **EOD**: Weekly status rhythm established with all stakeholders

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY
1. **Immediate Transparency**: Acknowledge gaps honestly while demonstrating control
2. **Scope Negotiation**: Separate "must-have" from "nice-to-have" features for Phase 1
3. **Client Partnership**: Convert client concerns into collaborative problem-solving
4. **Technical Focus**: Prioritize API stability and core functionality over advanced features

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
- **Dev Team**: Focused sprint on API configuration and core stability
- **Content Team**: Immediate decision on slide format to unblock content delivery
- **Client Success**: Daily touchpoints with Anita until confidence restored

## SUCCESS METRICS
- Client confidence restored within 48 hours
- Revised timeline agreed by Day 2
- Technical blockers resolved by end of week
- Go-live checklist approved and execution begun

**Bottom Line**: This is a challenging but manageable situation. The client relationship is salvageable with immediate action, clear communication, and realistic expectation setting. I'm taking ownership of the recovery plan and will provide daily updates until we're back on track.
